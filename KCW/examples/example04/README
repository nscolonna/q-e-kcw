This example shows how to use the KCW code to compute the band structure
of FCC Silicon using crystal symmetry. Same as example01 but working with the 
IBZ and using opengrid.x. This requires few steps:

1) run a standard scf calculation at PBE level on a reduced 2x2x2 MP grid. 

2) use opegrid.x to reconstruct all the KS state on the full 2x2x2 MP grid

3) perform a separate wannierization for the occupied and empty manifold 
   results in ./wann_occ and ./wann_emp, respectively

3) prepare the KCW calculation 
   input=Si.kcw-wann2kcw.in, output=Si.kcw-wann2kcw.out
   Now specity we are using the ibz by setting
   irr_bz = .true. 
   in the &CONTROL namelist

4) calculate the screening coefficients 
   input=Si.kcw-screen.in, output=Si.kcw-screen.out
   Now specity we are using the ibz by setting
   irr_bz = .true. 
   in the &CONTROL namelist

5) calculate, interpolate and diagonalize the KI Hamiltonian 
   input=Si.kcw-ham.in, output=Si.kcw-ham.out
   Now specity we are using the ibz by setting
   irr_bz = .true. 
   in the &CONTROL namelist

The Si band structure is in Si.kcw_bands.dat.
